  <div class="left"><h1>Allie - AI Voive Assistant</h1>
<p>This project highlighted key challenges in voice interaction design, from handling unexpected user input to troubleshooting unclear errors. Refining intents and responses was crucial to preventing conversation dead ends, while debugging required trial and error due to limited error indicators. Balancing simplicity with functionality proved tricky, as adding branches sometimes complicated the flow. These reinforced the importance of careful planning, iterative testing, and clear collaboration in creating effective voice interfaces.</p>

  <div class="centre"><h1>Lower Crochet Beginner Dropouts</h1>
<p>Desk research was conducted to better understand the situation. When diving into forums and threads created by crocheters, it is easy to notice that many people take up crochet to relieve stress. However, learning crochet ends up making them more stressed, leading them to quit.

But what about others who are still thriving at crochet? What keeps them going? Some crochet for charitable purposes, creating items for donations. Many people also find motivation in connecting with their ancestors through crochet, and others enjoy crocheting with friends, which further inspires them.</p>
